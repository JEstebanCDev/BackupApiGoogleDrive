# BackupApiGoogleDrive
The project is based on an Agent Job (SQL Server Manager) that creates a daily backup and is stored on the server, then we with the help of Google Cloud Platform - API do a daily upload with the help of a scheduled windows task, managing to store in a folder in google drive each backup.
